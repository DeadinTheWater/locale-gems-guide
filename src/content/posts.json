We've spent months discovering the city's most intimate, under-the-radar rooftop experiences.\n\n## 1. The Roof at Public Hotel\n\nTucked away on the Lower East Side, this rooftop offers panoramic views of Manhattan without the velvet rope attitude. The cocktail menu changes seasonally, and the vibe is effortlessly cool.\n\n## 2. Westlight at The William Vale\n\nIn Williamsburg, this 22nd-floor bar provides sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline across the East River. The design is sleek and modern, with floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\n## 3. Dear Irving on Hudson\n\nLocated atop the Aliz Hotel in Hell's Kitchen, this bar combines Art Deco glamour with some of the best craft cocktails in the city. The terrace is a hidden gem.",
